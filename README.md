CSC 212 - 211 Project
---------------------

Summary
---------------------
The task for this project was to create a gradebook for the CSC212 course. The gradebook must contain functions to return specific grades of specific assignments, total category grades, total overall grades, both weighted and current, and allow amendments to the “.txt” file which the grades will be entered from.

Planning
---------------------
We met several times throughout the duration of the project to discuss implementation and to bounce ideas off of one and other. Our early meetings were centered around discussing the basic structure of our code and developing good pseudocode to guide us through the rest of the process. The later meetings involved coding, implementing new elements we previously had not thought of, and debugging.

Instructions
---------------------
To compile our code, use the following command: 
g++ main.cpp gradebook.cpp -o program
